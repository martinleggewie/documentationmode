# The Documentation Mode

Describes a **set of workflows** built upon Emacs OrgMode and Git repositories to **document meetings as they happen** and to **schedule and assign tasks** in both professional and private life.

These workflows strive to meet the following main requirements:

* Be suitable not only for a single person, but also for a small amount of people working in a team.
* Allow to work offline, and only need to connect to the Internet once in a while.
* Use tools which are all publicly available and hence free of charge.
* Use tools which work on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

This tutorial consists of two main parts: 

* **[Part 1 explains how to use it](how-to-use.md)**.
If you first like to know how the workflows work and how they look and feel (and if you are not afraid of reading about a plethora of keyboard shortcuts), then start with this part.

* **[Part 2 explains how to set it all up](how-to-configure.md)**.
If you are interested in which tools you would need to install on your machine, and how to set them up, then have a look here.

Closing note: I have developed this workflow together with a former colleague of mine, and I have used it now for more than a year.
Although developing and getting used to it has been (and sometimes still is) a little bit painful, I use it every day because I always see its strengths.

Of course I hope that this workflow is something which would also suit your demands.
But even if you don't want to use it, you maybe can get some inspiration out of it which supports you in case you struggle with your own workflow.

_Some meta information about the markdown files I have created for this document:_

* _I use the GitHub flavor of markdown._
_See [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) for how to use it._

* _I follow the one sentence per line approach which I came across several years ago when learning AsciiDoc(tor)._
_See [https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line) for the reasoning behind this approach._
